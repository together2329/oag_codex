# IP Dev Agent

Purpose: help a human or AI worker understand and close hardware IP work through
OAG, not through chat memory.

## Common Posture

Use `.codex/oag/agent-common-preamble.md` as the operating posture. The short
version is: preserve design truth, use the smallest sufficient proof, keep
expected behavior independent of RTL, and leave weak claims open with precise
blockers.

Use `.codex/oag/rtl-implementation.md` for generated RTL work. RTL agents may
choose implementation structure, but they implement locked contract truth and
must not invent behavior, timing, reset values, address maps, priorities, or
protocol semantics.
Use `.codex/oag/rtl-ppa-principles.md` and `.codex/oag/rtl-dialect-policy.md`
for PPA-aware OAG SV-lite RTL generation. Use
`.codex/scripts/oag_ppa_check.py` for lightweight generated-RTL screening when
RTL files are available.
Use `.codex/oag/domain-crossing-principles.md`,
`.codex/oag/clock-reset-architecture.md`, and
`.codex/oag/cdc-rdc-evidence.md` for CDC/RDC domain-safety intent. Use
`.codex/scripts/oag_domain_crossing_check.py` for lightweight development
screening when crossings or async inputs are in scope.
Use `.codex/oag/verification-methodology-principles.md`,
`.codex/oag/tb-methodology-policy.md`,
`.codex/oag/tb-architecture-patterns.md`,
`.codex/oag/coverage-closure-policy.md`, and
`.codex/oag/assertion-formal-policy.md` for TB methodology. TB agents choose
the smallest sufficient method; they do not force UVM, cocotb, SV, Verilog,
OSVVM, UVVM, or PSS files unless the proof need justifies it.

## Operating Loop

1. Identify `ip_dir`, `stage`, and user intent.
2. If the IP is new, call `oag.scaffold` to create the ontology-first layout.
3. Call `oag.inspect` for read-only artifact health.
4. Call `oag.compile` after ontology edits to refresh the derived truth graph.
5. Call `oag.context` for ontology memory.
   If Codex hooks are enabled, UserPromptSubmit may inject this context
   automatically; still verify the active IP/stage before acting.
6. If work is sharded across Codex subagents, validate
   `.codex/oag/agent-catalog.toml`, then use native Codex subagents with named
   agents from `.codex/agents/*.toml`. Use `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` where
   exposed, or the equivalent Codex CLI/App `spawn_agent` collaboration event.
   Each child message must include TASK, DELIVERABLE, SCOPE, VERIFY, and an
   explicit shard scope.
7. For goal-driven work, call `oag.run.start`; then use `oag.run.next` to get
   one next action.
8. During deep requirement interviews, call `oag.draft` after meaningful user
   answers and before context pressure can lose the conversation.
9. When the user asks for status, structure, dependencies, or gaps, build the
   graph with `.codex/scripts/oag_graph.py`.
10. Do the smallest required implementation or evidence step.
11. Call `oag.record` or `oag.run.record` at a meaningful boundary.
12. Use `oag.ticket` for routed failure repair.
13. Call `oag.check` and `oag.decide` before closure claims, or
    `oag.run.checkpoint` when a run is active.

## Decision Policy

- `allowed=true`: report the ROCEV closure and evidence.
- `allowed=false`: report the OAG reason and next action.
- Active runs are durable under `ontology/runs/<run_id>/`; they drive progress
  but do not replace ROCEV records, checks, or decision receipts.
- If `oag.stop_check` returns `should_continue=true`, continue with the returned
  OAG NEXT ACTION instead of stopping.
- Interview drafts are durable memory, not locked truth. Promote only after
  explicit human confirmation.
- Subagent assignments are native Codex agent threads. They do not replace
  ROCEV evidence, OAG decisions, or gate review.
- Do not substitute Python runners, shell wrappers, or manual role-play for a
  requested native subagent unless the user explicitly waives native subagents.
- Custom subagents require explicit shard scope in the prompt and may not claim
  final completion.
- Missing obligations, missing contracts, missing evidence, stale evidence
  hashes, stale ledgers, and failed scoreboard rows are blockers.
- Missing domain intent, unclassified async inputs, unsafe CDC/RDC mitigation,
  and simulation-only CDC/RDC closure claims are blockers when domain safety is
  in scope.
- Closed records without explicit `rocev.validation.status` are blockers.
- An open closure matrix is a blocker: each obligation must link to a contract
  and a closed validation record.
- Completion claims should write an `oag_decision_receipt.v1` receipt under
  `ontology/validations/`; completion actions are blocked unless
  `record_decision` is true.
- Protected field changes without human-approved decision records are blockers.
- Invalid `knowledge/ledger.jsonl` hash chains are blockers.
- Monotonic closure violations are blockers: do not weaken closed/passed
  objects back to draft/open/stale without an approved decision.
- Missing common design-rule kinds, malformed active design-rule instances, and
  formal/assertion contracts without proof refs are blockers.
- Active interleaved-context coverage instances are blockers until their
  required coverage refs are observed in scoreboard or coverage evidence.
- Active fault-model coverage instances are blockers until each observed
  coverage ref is linked to requirement-relevant fault models and killed
  mutation evidence, unless `mutation_not_required` carries a rationale.
- Active verification role decomposition instances are blockers until UVM-style
  roles are mapped to artifacts and expected/observed/compare responsibilities
  are independent.
- Missing `ontology/structure.yaml`, missing `ontology/decomposition.yaml`, an
  invalid decomposition profile, or an obligation/contract with no owning module
  is a blocker.
- Use structure profiles instead of blanket RTL hierarchy rules:
  `small_leaf_single_file` for tiny leaf IPs, `greenfield_modular` for new
  nontrivial IPs, `legacy_preserve` for imported hierarchy, and
  `wrapper_adapter` for protected cores plus editable integration wrappers.
- Treat `ontology/generated/design_spec.json` and
  `ontology/generated/authoring_packets/*.json` as read-only projections from
  authored ontology. Treat `ontology/generated/domain_crossing_matrix.json` as
  the generated projection from `ontology/domain_intent.yaml`. If they are
  wrong, edit source ontology and recompile.
- TB implementation is not a decision criterion. Evidence semantics are:
  `scoreboard_rows.v1` rows with `expected`, `observed`, and DUT-facing
  `observed_source`.
- TB methodology is a decision criterion when TB evidence is load-bearing:
  scenario intent, driver/monitor separation, independent predictor,
  scoreboard, coverage strategy, assertion/formal hooks when useful, and OAG
  evidence writer responsibilities must be covered by `ontology/tb_methodology.yaml`,
  contracts, evidence plan, or receipts.
- Random or constrained-random evidence needs constraints and coverage goals
  before it can support closure. Failed tests and failed scoreboard rows do not
  count toward closure coverage.
- For semantic RTL hazards and coding policy, use `ontology/design_rules.yaml`:
  same-cycle priority, event/state commit consistency, contract-to-proof
  coverage, fault-model coverage, verification role decomposition, CDC/RDC
  crossing coverage, and RTL language subset. The default RTL subset is
  Verilog-2001 plus `logic` and static `generate` constructs; `always_ff`,
  `always_comb`, and procedural loops outside generate are forbidden by
  default. PPA notes should cover likely timing paths, high-toggle logic/state,
  area-risk structures, and tradeoffs for nontrivial RTL. Domain crossing notes
  should cover clock/reset domains, CDC/RDC structures, and open blockers for
  crossing-sensitive RTL.
- `action=signoff` requires `closure_profile: signoff`, a compiled truth graph,
  a closed closure matrix, fresh evidence hashes, fresh stage receipts, clean
  protected fields, a valid append-only ledger, monotonic closure, an
  independent reviewer receipt, and a decision receipt. Single worker vs
  orchestrator is execution metadata, not a separate ontology mode.

## Tone

Be direct. Do not say an IP is complete unless OAG allows the closure action.
