# OAG IP Versioning Policy

OAG IP versioning manages the functional version of one IP workspace. It is
separate from pack development versioning and assumes the IP directory can own
its own `.git` repository.

```text
IP-local git repo     = exact file tree for one IP
semantic IP version   = functional baseline lineage
baseline manifest     = audited truth/implementation/evidence scope
annotated git tag     = durable named baseline pointer
```

The product pack may live in a separate development repository. A user's IP
workspace may not have a parent git repository at all. For OAG baseline work,
the stewarded repository is the IP folder itself.

## IP-Local Repository Setup

OAG scaffolding initializes the IP folder as its own git repository by default.
For existing IP folders, initialize or repair the repository explicitly:

```bash
python3 .codex/scripts/oag_ip_git.py init --ip-dir <ip> --initial-commit --message "OAG scaffold <ip>" --json
```

Record routine checkpoints after meaningful OAG stage boundaries:

```bash
python3 .codex/scripts/oag_ip_git.py checkpoint --ip-dir <ip> --message "OAG <stage>: <meaningful summary>" --json
```

These checkpoints are an audit trail, not golden baseline promotion. Golden or
release promotion still requires a baseline manifest, validation/gate approval,
and an annotated tag.

The helper is shell-independent. It calls `git` directly from Python, so it is
compatible with macOS/Linux shells and Windows PowerShell. On Windows, Git for
Windows must be installed; `git.exe` on `PATH` is preferred, and common
`Program Files/Git/.../git.exe` locations are searched as a fallback. Git Bash
is optional.

The IP-local `.gitignore` is part of version readiness. It must ignore
rerunnable or large artifacts such as waveforms, simulator build directories,
raw simulator databases, logs, caches, and generated report directories while
keeping compact OAG, RTL, TB, script, filelist, SDC, and documentation
source-of-record files trackable.

## Canonical Ledger

The version steward reads and validates:

```text
<ip>/ontology/ip_version.yaml
```

Minimal shape:

```yaml
schema_version: oag_ip_version.v1
ip: example_ip
current_version: 0.1.1
version_policy:
  git_scope: ip_local_repo
  tag_prefix: oag/example_ip/
versions:
  - version: 0.1.0
    baseline_class: golden
    state: superseded
    change_class: initial
    functional_truth_changed: true
    baseline_manifest: ontology/baselines/example_ip_golden_v0.1.0.yaml
    git_tag: oag/example_ip/v0.1.0
    approval_ref: ontology/validations/example_ip_version_review.json
  - version: 0.1.1
    baseline_class: golden
    state: active
    change_class: patch
    functional_truth_changed: false
    baseline_manifest: ontology/baselines/example_ip_golden_v0.1.1.yaml
    git_tag: oag/example_ip/v0.1.1
    approval_ref: ontology/validations/example_ip_version_review.json
```

There must be exactly one `active` version, and `current_version` must match
it. Golden and release versions require an approval reference, baseline
manifest, and git tag.

## Version Classes

- `patch`: implementation, TB, evidence, script, or tool repair with unchanged
  functional truth. `functional_truth_changed` must be `false`.
- `minor`: requirement, decision, contract, interface, storage, timing, or
  oracle meaning changed in a backward-compatible way for the project.
- `major`: release/signoff meaning, incompatible interface behavior, or
  external contract changed in a way downstream users must consciously adopt.
- `initial`: first recorded version in an IP ledger.

Patch does not mean "small". It means the approved design truth is unchanged.
If the requirement, obligation, contract, decision matrix, locked truth,
behavior model, cycle rule, or firmware-visible meaning changes, the bump is
not patch.

## Golden Baseline

`golden` is a baseline class, not an artifact approval state. Artifact lifecycle
still uses approval and validity metadata. A golden baseline means the selected
truth, implementation, compact evidence, validation, gate record, and external
artifact references are frozen by a manifest and tag.

Golden promotion requires:

1. IP-local `.git` exists.
2. `ontology/ip_version.yaml` passes `oag_ip_version_check.py`.
3. The active version points to a baseline manifest.
4. The baseline manifest passes `oag_baseline_check.py`.
5. The manifest is committed in the IP-local repository.
6. The active version tag is an annotated git tag.
7. `oag_baseline_verify.py --verify-git-tag` passes.

The version steward may recommend a bump and report blockers. It must not create
golden/release tags or claim closure without an explicit human approval and gate
decision path.

## Git Relation

Use IP-local tags:

```text
oag/<ip>/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

The baseline manifest should keep:

```yaml
git:
  tag: oag/<ip>/v0.1.0
  commit: resolved_by_tag
  tag_type: annotated
```

Do not store a concrete self commit hash inside the manifest. Resolve the tag
when verification is requested.

## Agent Input Governance

The version ledger does not create design truth. It tells agents which approved
baseline lineage they may rely on.

- RTL/TB workers may consume active approved/golden baseline data only through
  generated authoring packets.
- Candidate, stale, or unapproved version entries are not implementation truth.
- A patch bump cannot hide a functional truth change.
- Superseded versions remain audit history but are not the current input unless
  a user explicitly requests comparison or rollback analysis.

Use:

```bash
python3 .codex/scripts/oag_ip_version_check.py --ip-dir <ip> --require-ip-git --json
```

Use `--verify-git-tag` after the baseline commit and annotated tag exist.
